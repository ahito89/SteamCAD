# Should anybody contribute to this project?
The intention of the SteamCAD author, as mentioned in the pdf manual, is not to develop the software
further. Which means not to add new functionality and let the software grow to the beasts like we know
from both comercial and community software.

So every suggestion to a new functionality will be considered very carefully and perhaps rejected, which
does not prevent anybody to create own fork and develop it further. But if the suggestion is meaningfull
and does not potentially decrease the performance of SteamCAD, it may be accepted to the master.

Still there are definitively areas where contributions would be highly appreciated, for example:

## Graphics
A genuine icon for the application as well as a picture for the About dialog box would be welcome. Also
nice drawings created in SteamCAD would be appreciated and added to the samples.

## Translation
This means providing code to enable gettext in the Linux version and provide the po files, and/or
translate the SteamCAD.rc for the Windows version. See TRANSLATIONS.md for more details.

## Deployment
Also contributing with automake and autoconf source files, as well as an msi installation package for
Windows would be appreciated. However these both would require some changes in the code, which I am willing
to participate on.

## Bug Fixes
If you find a bug you can report it via the issues, or you can even propose a fix via pull request.
